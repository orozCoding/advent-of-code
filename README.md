# Advent of Code

Ho ho ho! Welcome to my Advent of Code journey! ‍
This repo will be my home for all the solutions and code I create for the Advent of Code challenges!  I'm so excited to delve into the daily puzzles and flex my coding muscles!

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers tackle coding puzzles each day of December. It's a fun way to sharpen your skills, learn new things, and get into the festive spirit! ❄️

The OG one is [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/) (I think?), and is my main goal in this repo.

But I will be adding other devs/content creators' Advent of Code challenges to my list as well, like [AventJS](https://adventjs.dev/) from [MiduDev](https://midu.dev/)

## What will you find here?
My solutions for each day's puzzle, mainly JS (maybe TypeScript too!)
Explanations and comments on my thought process and approach
Hopefully, some creative and elegant solutions to the problems
Most importantly, a record of my learning and growth throughout this coding adventure!

Feel free to:
- Check out my solutions and see how I tackled the problems!
- Fork this repo and use it as a starting point for your own solutions!
- Leave comments and feedback to help me improve!

Let's embark on this coding journey together and have fun along the way!

Happy coding and Merry Christmas! ‍
